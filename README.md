For Django, another option will be to use Flask.
But Django comes with many more default features than Flask. For this project we don't have much time. Django will allow us to go faster.

## Challenge Statement
The problem the project is intended to solve is to help people translate word in multiple languages and keep track of the words they learned
The project will help people learn faster
The project will make it easy to classify words and review them

## Risks
Technical Risks: A potential technical risk could be the platform not being able to handle a large number of users or data. To mitigate this, the platform will be hosted on a scalable cloud infrastructure.

## Non-Technical Risks:
A potential non-technical risk could be a lack of interest or adoption of the platform by the target users. To prevent this, the platform will be designed to be user-friendly and meet the needs of the target audience, Another risk can be the wrong translation and that can be solved by providing translation from other sources

## Existing Solutions
Google Translate

#### Similarities:
